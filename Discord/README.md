We use [Discord](https://discord.com/) as a smoother and more user-friendly communication platform 
for discussing the extra activities we do, like our group projects, solving the issues we encounter 
while working with Git and GitHub, etc.

Discord can be downloaded [here](https://discord.com/download).

All the material there is not mandatory for the course, however, some of it may really help.

During the lectures the Discord program and the issues discussed there will be mentioned at times.
Usually all students join in there, just in case they may need to discuss something in the future,
or read some of the existing threads.

To join our study group server, invite the lecturer via Discord as a connection, and then you will
be added to the server.
