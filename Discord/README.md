We use [Discord](https://discord.com/) as a more smooth and user friendly communication platform 
for discussing the extra activities we do, like our group project, solving the issues we encounter 
while working with Git and GitHub, etc.

All the material there is not mandatory for the course, however, some of it may really help.

During the lectures Discord and issues discussed there will be mentioned at times. Usually
all students join in there, just in case they may need to discuss something in the future,
or read some of the existing threads.
