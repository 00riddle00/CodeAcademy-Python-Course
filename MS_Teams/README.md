This directory ([MS_Teams/](./)) is used to indicate the directory structure from 
the MS Teams platform of this course.

There are no files themselves here, but instead there are short text-like
references to them.

In [this exact](https://github.com/00riddle00/CodeAcademy-Python-Course) repository,
[MS_Teams/](./) directory serves only as a template, and is therefore empty.

-------------

Microsoft Teams can be downloaded [here](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/log-in).

The files referenced can be accessed in MS Teams.

There is also another, a more convenient way to access them outside of MS Teams:
* Go to [Office 365](https://www.office.com/), log in with your Microsoft account.
* Click on "OneDrive" icon on the sidebar on the left.
* Navigate to General/ directory.

P.S. You can also try out other Microsoft Tools in Office 365.
