## Python

[![Python logo](https://i.imgur.com/ZvwPFqE.png)](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/python/)

[Python](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/python/) is an amazing 
[programming language](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) named after 
[Monty Python's Flying Circus](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/foreword/) 
and brings joy to life since 1991.

There is a saying that programming with Python is the most fun activity you can have with your
clothes still on.

### Usage

##### Python file `the_zen_of_python.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
#   ^---Use a shebang to mark this file to be interpreted by Python 3.
#       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)

import this
```

##### Running the Python file:
Either running like this:
```shell
user@ubuntu:~$ python3 the_zen_of_python.py
#
# this would also work:
user@ubuntu:~$ mv the_zen_of_python.py the_zen_of_python
user@ubuntu:~$ python3 the_zen_of_python
```
or this:
```shell
user@ubuntu:~$ chmod +x the_zen_of_python.py # Mark the file as executable
user@ubuntu:~$ ./the_zen_of_python.py
#
# this would also work:
user@ubuntu:~$ mv the_zen_of_python.py the_zen_of_python
user@ubuntu:~$ ./the_zen_of_python
```

```
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

## Flask

[![Flask logo](https://i.imgur.com/ixTf9AV.png)](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)

[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) is a lean and awesome 
[Python web framework](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks) which first came into existence
on April 1, 2010 as an [April fools joke](http://mitsuhiko.pocoo.org/flask-pycon-2011.pdf).

It seems this just can't get any more serious.

## Django

[![Django logo](https://i.imgur.com/6UZQvYr.png)](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.

Django aims to follow Pythonâ€™s 
["batteries included" philosophy](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#tut-batteries-included).
It ships with a variety of extra, optional tools that solve common web development problems.
